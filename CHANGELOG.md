# Changelog for TGM Plugin Activation library

## Trunk

* .... [#](). Props [](). Thanks []() for reporting.

* Enhancement: Better support for GitHub hosted plugins:
	Previously using standard GitHub packaged zips as download source would not work as, even though the plugin would be installed, it would not be recognized as such by TGMPA because of the non-standard directory name which would be created for the plugin, i.e. `my-plugin-master` instead of `my-plugin`. A work-around for this has been implemented and you can now use GitHub-packaged `master` branch or release zips to install plugins. Have a look at the `example.php` file for a working example.
	One caveat: this presumes that the plugin is based in the root of the GitHub repo and not in a `/src` subdirectory.

Thanks [Dan Fisher](https://github.com/danfisher85) and [Luis Martins](https://github.com/lmartins) for reporting/requesting this enhancement.

* Admin Page improvements:
	- Allow for filtering of the plugin action links on the admin page similar to WP Core. The available filters are `tgmpa_plugin_action_links` and `tgmpa_network_plugin_action_links`. [#300](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/300), [#226](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/226) Thanks [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl) for the inspiration.
	- Leverage the css styling of the Core plugins page [#227](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/227). Props [Shiva Poudel](https://github.com/shivapoudel).
	- Allow for moving the Admin Page to a different place in the menu. This is mainly to accommodate plugins using TGMPA as it is terribly illogical for the TGMPA page to be under the 'Appearance' menu in that case. This has been now been done in a way that Theme Check will not choke on it. [](), [#310](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/310/), [](), []() Props [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl).

* Admin notices improvements:
	- For installs including both plugins as well as themes, notices will now be dismissable for each separately. This prevents a situation where a theme would have TGMPA included, the user has dismissed the notice about it, a plugin with TGMPA gets installed and the notice about it requiring certain other plugins is never shown. [#174](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/174) Thanks [Chris Howard](https://github.com/qwertydude) for reporting.
	- Fixed: The reset of dismissed notices on `switch_theme` was only applied for the current user, not for all users. [#246](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/246) Props [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl).
	- Fixed: Admin notices would show twice under certain circumstances. [#249](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/249), [#237](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/237) Props [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl). Thanks [manake](https://github.com/manake) for reporting.

* Bulk Installer:
	- Fixed: Bundled/pre-packaged plugins would no longer install when using the Bulk installer. This was a regression introduced in v2.4.1. [#321](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/321), [#316](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/316) Props [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl). Thanks [tanshcreative](https://github.com/tanshcreative) for reporting.
	- Fixed: If a bulk install was initiated using the bottom _Bulk Actions_ dropdown, the install page would display an outdated TGMPA plugin table at the bottom of the page after the bulk installation was finished. [#319](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/319) Props [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl).
	- Fixed: The `Show Details` links no longer worked. This was a regression briefly introduced in the `develop` branch. [#326](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/326)

* Theme Check compatibility:
	- Removed call to `screen_icon()` function which was deprecated in WP 3.8. [#244](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/244), [#224](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/224), [#234](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/234). Props [Nate Wright](https://github.com/NateWr). Thanks [hamdan-mahran](https://github.com/hamdan-mahran) and [Sandeep](https://github.com/InsertCart) for reporting.
	- Prevent _"The theme appears to use include or require"_ warning. [#262](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/262), [#258](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/258) Props [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl). Thanks [Tim Nicholson](https://github.com/timnicholson) for reporting.
	- Preempt the disallowing of the use of the `add_theme_page()` function. See [the theme review meeting notes](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/04/21/this-weeks-meeting-important-information-regarding-theme-options/) for further information on this decision. [#315](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/315) Props [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl).

* Miscellaneous fixes:
	- Fixed: _"PHP Fatal error: Class 'TGM_Bulk_Installer' not found"_ [#185](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/185) Thanks [Chris Talkington](https://github.com/ctalkington) for reporting.
	- Fixed: _"Undefined index: skin_update_failed_error"_ [#260](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/260), [#240](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/240) Props [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl). Thanks [Parhum Khoshbakht](https://github.com/parhumm) and [Sandeep](https://github.com/InsertCart) for reporting.
	- Made admin urls environment aware. [#255](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/255), [#171](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/171) Props [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl).
	- Fixed: the Adminbar would be loaded twice causing conflicts (with other plugins). [#208](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/208) Props [John Blackbourn](https://github.com/johnbillion).

* I18N improvements:
	- Make configurable message texts singular/plural context aware. [#173](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/173) Props [Yakir Sitbon](https://github.com/KingYes).
	- Language strings which are being overridden should use the including plugin/theme language domain. [217](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/217/) Props [Christian Foellmann](https://github.com/cfoellmann).

* Housekeeping:
	- Applied a number of best practices.

	- Cleaned up some of the documentation. [#179](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/179) Props [Gregory Karpinsky](https://github.com/tivnet).

## 2.4.1 (2015-04-22)

* Improve escaping for URLs and attributes.

## 2.4.0 (2014-03-17)

* All textdomain strings now made to `tgmpa` and remove all notices dealing with textdomain and translation issues.
* The `_get_plugin_basename_from_slug` method now checks for exact slug matches to prevent issues with plugins that start with the same slug.
* Commenting style now adjusted so it is easier to comment large chunks of code if necessary.
* Plugins from an external source now properly say `Private Repository` in the list table output.
* `add_submenu_page` has been changed to `add_theme_page` for better theme check compatibility.
* Removed the use for `parent_menu_slug` and `parent_menu_url` for $config options (see above).
* Nag messages can now be forced on via a new `dismissable` config property. When set to false, nag cannot be dismissed.
* New config `dismiss_msg` used in conjunction with `dismissable`. If `dismissable` is false, then if `dismiss_msg` is not empty, it will be output at the top of the nag message.
* Better contextual message for activating plugins - changed to "Activate installed plugin(s)" to "Begin activating plugin(s)".
* Added cache flushing on theme switch to prevent stale entries from remaining in the list table if coming back to a theme with TGMPA.
* TGMPA is now a singleton to prevent extra settings overrides.
* Fixed bug with duplicating plugins if multiple themes/plugins that used TGMPA were active at the same time.
* Added contextual message updates depending on WordPress version.
* Better nag message handling. If the nag has been dismissed, don't even attempt to build message (performance enhancement).
* Ensure class can only be instantiated once (instantiation moved inside the `class_exists` check for TGMPA).
* Change instances of `admin_url` to `network_admin_url` to add better support for MultiSite (falls back gracefully for non-MultiSite installs).
* Updated much of the code to match WP Coding Standards (braces, yoda conditionals, etc.).
* Myriads of other bug fixes and enhancements
